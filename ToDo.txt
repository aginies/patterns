* Make Base system smaller:

  Definition Base System:
  Purpose: Minimal booting system running on real hardware 
  Multiuser system with:
  * Local login (via /etc/passwd)
  * network setup via ethernet
  * default filesystems used (ext3) directly (without evms, lvm,
    mdraid etc)
  * no services running by default
  * YaST modules for 2nd part of installation

  Philosophy: If I want or need it, i'll selected & install it.

  Add another pattern with extra packages from current base system.

* Add opensuse-updater(-gnome) to the correct patterns.
